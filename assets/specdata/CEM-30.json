    "price": -1,
    "stock": 300,
    "description": "The CEM30 is a new brushless DC motor with torque up to 30Nm. Its advanced gearbox, composed of an eccentrically-rotating cycloidal disk and traditional planetary system, ensures that the actuator is powerful, lightweight, and compact. The CEM30 is ideal for applications that require high torque in a small package, such as robotics arms. The CEM30's CAN bus also provides ultra-fast, low-latency communication, making it the perfect actuator for high-performance applications.",
